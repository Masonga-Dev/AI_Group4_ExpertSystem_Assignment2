# Rule-Based Expert System for Agricultural Crop Recommendation
# Crop Recommendation Expert System

## Description
This expert system provides recommendations for suitable crops based on climate conditions. Users input temperature, rainfall, soil type, and altitude, and the system suggests the best crops based on predefined rules.

## Features
- **Rule-Based Decision System**: Uses predefined conditions to recommend crops.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web form for entering climate data.
- **Web-Based Deployment**: Hosted on Binder with Flask backend and GitHub Pages for documentation.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant crop recommendations based on user input.

## How It Works
1. **User Inputs Data**:
   - Temperature (Â°C)
   - Rainfall (mm)
   - Soil Type (Loamy, Clayey, Sandy)
   - Altitude (meters)
2. **System Processes Input**:
   - Matches input values with predefined rules.
   - Determines the most suitable crops.
3. **Displays Recommended Crops**:
   - Outputs a list of suggested crops based on conditions.
